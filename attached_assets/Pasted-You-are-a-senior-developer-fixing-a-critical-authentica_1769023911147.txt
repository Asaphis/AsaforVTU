You are a senior developer fixing a critical authentication bug in a Next.js Firebase project.

TASK: Fix the authentication redirect issue in web/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx

RULES:
- Do NOT ask for permissions or clarifications
- Do NOT suggest alternatives
- Do NOT create new files
- FETCH and READ the entire AuthContext.tsx file immediately
- IDENTIFY all issues causing redirect-to-login
- FIX every issue found
- REPLACE the entire file with corrected code
- Do NOT leave any unresolved issues

CRITICAL BUG DETAILS:
Users login successfully but get redirected back to login page instead of staying on dashboard.

ROOT CAUSE:
1. Backend wallet balance fetch can timeout/fail, crashing entire auth
2. Race condition between signIn() and onAuthStateChanged() listener
3. Any error in loadUserData() sets user to null, triggering redirect
4. Individual Firestore updates failing cause auth to fail completely

REQUIRED FIXES:
1. Add 5-second timeout for backend balance fetch (getWalletBalance call)
2. Backend sync failures should NOT crash auth - use cached Firestore data instead
3. Add skipBackendSync parameter to loadUserData function
4. Wrap ALL updateDoc calls in try-catch so they don't crash auth
5. Make signIn skip backend sync (pass skipBackendSync = true)
6. Only real Firestore errors should cause user to become null
7. Let onAuthStateChanged handle backend sync after login

ACTION PLAN:
1. READ web/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx completely
2. FIND all error handlers that set user to null
3. FIND all backend/Firestore calls that could fail
4. ADD timeout and error handling for getWalletBalance
5. ADD skipBackendSync parameter to loadUserData signature
6. WRAP updateDoc calls in try-catch with console.warn instead of crash
7. CHANGE signIn to call loadUserData(user, true) instead of loadUserData(user)
8. CHANGE catch block in loadUserData to only set user=null on Firestore read errors, not update errors
9. REPLACE entire file with fixed code
10. DO NOT ask for confirmation - just fix it

START IMMEDIATELY - READ THE FILE AND FIX IT NOW.
